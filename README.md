# üè° California Housing Price Prediction

This repository provides a machine learning model for predicting housing prices in California, built from scratch using **Normal Equation** and **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** methods. The model is trained on the California Housing dataset, and users can interact with the model through a user-friendly front-end interface.
