## ðŸ“– Introduction

In this project, we will explore the California housing dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement machine learning models to predict housing prices. We will compare the performance of different regression techniques.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive coding environment.
- etc ...

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the California housing dataset, which includes features such as:

- **MedInc**: Median income in the block group (in tens of thousands of dollars).
- **HouseAge**: Median house age in the block group (in years).
- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per house in the block group.
- **AveOccup**: Average number of occupants per house in the block group.
- **Latitude**: Latitude of the block group (geographical coordinate).
- **Longitude**: Longitude of the block group (geographical coordinate).
- **Population**: Total number of people residing in the block group.
- **MedHouseVal**: Median house value (target variable) in the block group (in hundreds of thousands of dollars).
